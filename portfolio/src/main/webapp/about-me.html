                            I love the powerful yet elegant kicks unique to this art!

                            I enjoy learning about new and different skills/subjects,
                            ranging from crocheting to nutrition and bodybuilding to martial

                            I would love to visit Tokyo and South Korea in the near

                            In my free time, I enjoy playing strategy games such as

                            My ethnicity is Hmong! Historically, my people don't have a country
                            of our own. The Hmong people lived as farmers in the remote hillsides of Laos,
                            Thailand, and Vietnam.

                            Most Hmong-Americans live in either California or Minnesota.

                            Within CS, I am most excited about artificial intelligence because
                            of it's potential to reshape our world for better or worse.

                            I am scared of being clueless in a world where technology defines
